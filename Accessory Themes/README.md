# Accessory Themes
Dependent on Additional Card Info to know what is a Hair Accessory

A whole lot of Color related stuff.

Reduce the amount of work you have to do if you want to change an entire outfit with a ton of accessories.

Create a Theme, all accessories that get the Theme applied will use the theme colors on application.

	 Backwards compatible with previously made outfits? 

Ya sure why not find it "Accessory Settings" in the clothing section. It's called Generate Themes, will make groups of themes with similar colors palettes based on the tolerance, won't be the minimum required themes sadly so you'll have to figure out which ones are safe to merge.

Select a theme and you can change the selected color of choice on all accessories that share the theme.

	Multiple themes with the same color?
	
Hit the get relative colors, of course be sure to state which themes are "fixed" first to not include them, these will give you a list of colors to choose from at the time the button was clicked.

	Want to shift the color the entire outfit (including cloths)?
	
With relative colors generated change the Skew color and it the apply button. The Color displayed is relative to Red (0) and it wraps around.
I just shift the Hue of everything and avoid touching the Saturation and Values.

	Why not touch Saturation and Values?
	
I'll probably re-add the feature, but it'll probably be seperate sliders to allow better control of theses since small changes tend to have annoyingly big impact as values have to be clamped at 0 or 1 and details will probably be lost if you want to signigicantly change these values.
