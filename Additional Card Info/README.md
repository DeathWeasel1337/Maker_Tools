# Additional Card Info
 
 	Currently Cosplay Academy only uses the Keep/Non-replaceable Category.
	All are accessible within the Clothing section in maker

## Additional Character Info
	Settings Tab
### Keep Clothing Parts
	Will keep the selected clothing part on all characters, primarily for characters who are unable to change/wear a piece of clothing in said slot.
	
### Cosplay Ready
Character has all required accessories and keeps marked

	What do you mean by required accessories and keeps being marked?

Characters who's hair is made out of accessories, have animal ears, appendages and/or for whatever reason unable to change a particular part of their outfit.

#### Mecha Chika Example
Here I have an example provided to me by Anon11, whose umm... type... is probably impossible to generalize any logic to keep what needs to be kept

Her right bicep downwards is made of accessories and a glove, while both her legs thigh downwards are accessories and shoes.

Since all her accessories (aside from hair) are to be marked to keep and hair marked as hair and since she requires her shoes and gloves those categories are selected.

After rolling a couple of times you might notice that she doesn't exactly work well with any outfits that have pantyhoses/socks so you can exclude both of those as well.

	1. Normal
	2. Normal With Cosplay Academy (hair is kept cause Cosplay Academy keeps all head and tail accessories originally)
	3. "Cosplay Academy Ready" With Cosplay Academy (all required accessories should be marked as keep accessory or is hair)

## Additional Coordinate Info
### Author: Creator of coordinate
Can be set to a name in settings so you don't have to type your name everytime
### Set Name: Name of coordinate set it belongs too.
Name of the set the coordinate belongs to. Fine to leave it blank if it isn't a Set

Example: Futuzor Lingerie Pack
		
### Sub Set Name: Name of coordinate sub set	
	Example using Futuzor Lingerie Pack: Lace
	for further subsets plan is to just add-on to subset with '\' such as Lace\Red
			
### Coordinate Sub type: Coordinate description
	General for the normal coordinate. If only a shirt, use top. If a full underwear set use Lingerie
	
### Non-replaceable: Parts to not be changed on this coordinate (assuming no personal restriction) 
Cosplay Academy has an Underwear replacement feature, I would like to think I did a decent job, but sometimes a specialized outfit just falls through.

### A ton of toggles
Restrict the outfit from being choosen for people who aren't supposed to be compatible with it.
